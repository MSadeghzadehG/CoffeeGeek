    * coffee has various kind of beans and brew methods so you have wide choice to find your own taste and flavor
    * it makes you happy =)) and finally you love that ;)
* ### how to brew coffee at home?
    brewing coffee has 2 main steps:
    1. prepare coffee beans and grind them
    2. choose brewing method and brew coffee
    #### coffee bean
    A coffee bean is a seed of the coffee plant and the source for coffee.
    The flavor of your coffee all comes down to the variety of bean, and you only need to care about two of them: arabica and robusta.
     
     Arabica is preferred for its fruity, sweeter taste as well as higher acidity.
     Robusta has less flavor and chemical complexity than the arabica coffee bean. it has a much higher caffeine content than arabica coffee and less expensive coffee for you.
    
   the chemical and physical properties transform of green coffee beans into roasted coffee products called roasting process. The roasting process is what produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the green coffee beans to change in taste. Unroasted beans contain similar if not higher levels of acids, protein, sugars, and caffeine as those that have been roasted, but lack the taste of roasted coffee beans due to the Maillard and other chemical reactions that occur during roasting.
   
    generally, roasting coffee beans fall into one of the following categories: light, medium, medium-dark, and dark roasts. 
    * As coffee roasts get darker, they lose the origin flavors of the beans and take on more flavor from the roasting process.
    * The body of the coffee gets heavier, until the second crack, where the body again thins.
    * Lighter roasts have more acidity than darker roasts.
    * Light roasted beans are dry, while darker roasts develop oil on the bean surface.
    * The caffeine level decreases as the roast gets darker.
    Ultimately, it’s all about the taste, the flavor, the aroma. You may prefer a lighter roast in the morning (with more caffeine) and a darker one later in the day. Coffee, including the optimal roast level, is a personal preference.
     
    coffee flavor can change dramatically from region to region and farm to farm within a single country. beacuse of similar whether we can make generalizations about a country’s coffee flavor. More than 50 countries produce coffee, but you may want to start with some of the more famous regions, and get to know their flavor profiles before moving on to more exotic varieties.

    some useful notes:
    * best place to buy coffee is a local, small, independent coffee shop. 
    * Always buy whole beans.
    * Coffee bean freshness is subjective but important.
    * avoid both overbuying coffee and letting those carefully selected beans lose their freshness, or not buying enough and encountering a morning tragedy.
