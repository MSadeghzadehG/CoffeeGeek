* ### how to brew coffee at home?
    brewing coffee has 2 main steps:
    1. prepare coffee beans and grind them
    2. choose brewing method and brew coffee
    #### coffee bean
    A coffee bean is a seed of the coffee plant and the source for coffee.
    The flavor of your coffee all comes down to the variety of bean, and you only need to care about two of them: arabica and robusta.
     Arabica is preferred for its fruity, sweeter taste as well as higher acidity.
     Robusta has less flavor and chemical complexity than the arabica coffee bean. it has a much higher caffeine content than arabica coffee and less expensive coffee for you.
    
    some useful notes:
    * best place to buy coffee is a local, small, independent coffee shop. 
    * Always buy whole beans.
    * Coffee bean freshness is highly subjective.
    * More than 50 countries produce coffee, but you may want to start with some of the more famous regions, and get to know their flavor profiles before moving on to more exotic varieties.
    * avoid both overbuying coffee and letting those carefully selected beans lose their freshness, or not buying enough and encountering a morning tragedy.
